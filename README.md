# StockRecommendations    Daily Stock Picks 

This is a collection of Stock Screen, Subject to future additions.

The idea is that after setup, you will receive an email for each screener when you turn on your computer every morning to trade stocks 

The list of stock picks (from spx500)  in those emails are selected based on each respective strategy (more on this below) with real time market data from yahoo finance. 

There are two screeners up and running now:

1. KDrise
2. KDJ cross



# How to use:

1. Download src 
2. Go into each .py file and input your sender and receiver email 
3. Search for Task Scheduler in your start menu and create new tasks to run when your computer starts
4. The action blank should be: " python.exe KDrise.py " for instance. 
5. done

1. KD rise  
   Screens for the influx based on K line and D line. A quite generic stochastic indicator formula
   
2. KDJcross 
   KDJ is the stochastic oscillator indicator. The reputation of KDJ has been getting worse since covid, but this one has my little twist in it
   
# DISCLAIMER

For your own sake, please run and scrutinize these stock picks for at least a week before committing anything. All in all, these are just for telling you where to direct your focus for your day's trading.
